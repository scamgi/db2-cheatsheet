\section*{Triggers}

\subsection*{General Rules}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A trigger is a stored procedure in a database that automatically executes when a specific event occurs in the database server.
    \item \textbf{Events:} \texttt{INSERT}, \texttt{UPDATE}, \texttt{DELETE}.
    \item \textbf{Timing:} \texttt{BEFORE} or \texttt{AFTER} the event.
    \item \textbf{Granularity:} Can be row-level (fires for each affected row) or statement-level (fires once per statement).
    \item \textbf{OLD and NEW:} Special keywords to access the row's state before and after the data modification.
\end{itemize}
