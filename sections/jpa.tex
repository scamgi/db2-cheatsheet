\section*{JPA (Java Persistence API)}

\subsection*{General Rules}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Entity:} A lightweight persistence domain object. Must have a no-arg constructor and a primary key.
    \item \textbf{EntityManager:} The main interface for persistence operations (persist, merge, remove, find).
    \item \textbf{Persistence Context:} A set of managed entity instances. Changes are tracked here.
    \item \textbf{JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language):} An object-oriented query language similar to SQL.
    \item \textbf{Relationships:} Annotations like \texttt{@OneToOne}, \texttt{@OneToMany}, \texttt{@ManyToOne}, \texttt{@ManyToMany}.
\end{itemize}
