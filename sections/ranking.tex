\subsection*{Top-k Algorithms}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{MedRank:} A threshold algorithm for multimedia databases.
    \item \textbf{B0 (Baseline):} A simple algorithm, often used as a benchmark.
    \item \textbf{MaxOptimal:} An algorithm that aims for maximum efficiency.
    \item \textbf{NRA (No Random Access):} A top-k algorithm that only uses sorted access.
    \item \textbf{FA (Fagin's Algorithm):} A classic threshold algorithm using both sorted and random access.
    \item \textbf{TA (Threshold Algorithm):} A family of algorithms (including FA) for top-k queries over multiple lists.
    \item \textbf{SFS (Stream-Combine Fagin-Sorted):} An algorithm for top-k processing on data streams.
\end{itemize}
